# odin-recipes
The Odin Project (TOP) Course, first project building a recipe website using only HTML5

In this project I have successfully demonstrated the capability to use HTML5 and make a project with it. I have used a unordered list to list ingredients in this project, ordered list to list off the steps of the recipe. I have demonstrated using headings like <h1> and <h2> for the organization of the steps in this project as well as the <p> tag for the image description.
